# BDT@e
Basic eigital twins @ erasand of real estate for communication

## Why
Digital twins are made with the BIM methodology (Building Information Modelling). We will present information about buildings represented by digital twins.

## What
- Ifc Models are the basis
- Conversion in a format to displaying online
- Create views and combine with data

## How
- Ifc Models are created with CAD
- Conversion with https://3dviewer.net/ to Gltf format
- Analize used materials with https://3dviewer.net/
- Manuipulate the transparency of the materials to bring out certain parts with a text editor
- Create different views with https://3dviewer.net/
- Publish models in combination with information on a web page

## Example process
1. Real estate project
2. 3D model, ifc model, BIM planned project
3. Need to communicate with digital twins
4. Which customers do I want to reach
5. View definition
6. Data drop of the models as basis for the views
7. Model conversion to GLTF format
8. View creation
   
   a. Edit materials
   
   b. Set start viewpoint
   
   c. Publish in the cloud
   
9. Integration of views into online communication
